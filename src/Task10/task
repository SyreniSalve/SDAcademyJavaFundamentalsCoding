Write an application that gets one positive number (type int) from the user and calculates a
sum of digits of the given number. Hint: to make some operations on every single digit of the
number (digit by digit), you can calculate the remainder of dividing the number by 10 (to get the value of the last digit)
and divide the number by 10 (to "move" to the next digit)
