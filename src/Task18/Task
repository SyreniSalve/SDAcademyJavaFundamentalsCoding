Write an application that reads a text from the user (type String) and checks whether the user sneezed, i.e. whether the text equals ‘achooo!’ with one or more letters "o" at the end of the expression (so both 'acho!' and ‘achooooooo!’ are correct). Hint: use a regular expression with the appropriate quantifier.
